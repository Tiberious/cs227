In order to run the programs in this repository you will need to save the the stdlib.jar and then either make an alias 
that refrences it (i.e. -cp .:desktop/stdlib.jar) or input what is in the parenthese before the compile / run 
command on the command prompt. Feel free to message me with any questions and hopefully I can help. 

A side note - each folder contains all the files necessary for the final client program within that 
folder to run.
