The client program within this folder is Guitar Hero. Just save that file, compile and then
start pressing away on your keyboard to create music. The image (keyboard.jpg) provided
shows you what keys on the keyboard correspond to what notes using a picture of a piano keyboard.
More developmemt on this program is coming soon, like a note frequency visualizer.
